          <h2>Privacy Policy.</h2>
          <p><strong>Updated on 11 Apr 2020.</strong><br/>
            <strong>*</strong> <i>Feedbacks to this project are disabled for now. Thanks for all your support and help!</i></p>
          <h5>Who Am I and What This Policy Covers</h5>
          <p>Namaste! I am Sudipto, the guy behind the keyboard, working on this Project. I do not have a personal website ready yet (Though I had one about 3 months ago, however, had to take it offline due to the new GDPR rules), but I am working on the
            new site and hopefully, it should be completed soon. I used to work as a freelance Front-End and Motion/Graphic Designer and Developer, currently, working as a Full-Timer for a web development corporation. This Privacy Policy applies to information
            that I collect about you when you use this Web Application.</p>
          <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy I’ll refer to Project Retrowave and the services provided as a part of this Web Application, collectively as “Services.”</p>
          <h5>Information I Collect</h5>
          <p>I only collect information about you if I have a reason to do so–for example, to provide the Services, to communicate with you, or to make the Services better. I collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically
            through operating the Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that I collect.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Information You Provide Me</em></strong></p>
          <p>It’s probably no surprise that I collect information that you provide me. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how I use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Basic Information:</strong> I ask for basic information like your Name and valid Email Address if you provide a feedback* or report a bug through the Web Application.</li>
              <li><strong>Other Information:</strong> As a part of the feedback* or bug report through the Web Application, if you include some Personal Information-for example, your Phone Number etc. I will receive the same in my inbox and will be aware about
                it. However, these details are not mandatory to be included when you send me a message as a part of the feeback or bug report.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Information I Collect Automatically</em></strong></p>
          <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, I collect information that Google Analytics typically make available, such as the Device you used to access Project Retrowave, Referrals to Project Retrowave, Keywords
                you used to reach this Web Application if you landed up here through Search Engines.</li>
              <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> I collect information about your usage of the Services. For example, I collect information about the Pages you visited while using this Web Application, the time you spent on each page and your visit behaviour
                to the Web application, so I can make the Services better.</li>
              <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> With the help of Google Analytics this Web Application determines the location of your device from your IP address. I will collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people
                visit the Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
              <li><strong>Stored Information:</strong> When the no sign up features are ready, it will use your the data stored in your browsers Local Storage or Local Database to keep track of your infomration related to the Web Application. Meaning, all
                information will not be uploaded to any remote server - but will be present and stored within your browser itself and will be used by Project Retrowave as a part of the core feature mentioned above.</li>
              <li><strong>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website/web app stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website/web app each time the visitor
                returns. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google LLC that tracks and reports website traffic. Project Retrowave uses cookies and other technologies like Google Analytics to help identify and track visitors, usage,
                and access preferences for the Services.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h5>How And Why I Use Information</h5>
          <p><strong><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></strong></p>
          <p>I use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To provide the Services–for example, The no sign up feature which will exempt the need of creating an account here to manage your own Playlists, Favorites, History of Songs played etc;</li>
              <li>To further develop and improve the Services–for example by adding new features that I think users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their information related to the Web Application more efficiently;
              </li>
              <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with the Services, which helps me improve the Services and make them easier to use;</li>
              <li>To monitor and prevent any problems with the Services; and
              </li>
              <li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about feedback*s* and bug reports. I will not use the email to send any marketing or promotional email about any third party services however.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></strong></p>
          <p>A note here for those in the European Union about my legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that my use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to
            fulfill my commitments to you under the Terms of Service or other agreements with you; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another
            person; or (4) I have a legitimate interest in using your information--for example, to provide and update the Services, to improve the Services so that I can offer you an even better user experience, to communicate with you, and better understand
            user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with the Services, and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given me your consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and them
            to provide you the Services.</p>
          <h5>Sharing Information</h5>
          <p><strong><em>How I Share Information</em></strong></p>
          <p>I do not sell users’ private personal information. I share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independent Contributers:</strong> I may disclose information about you to individuals who are independent contributers to this Project that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the
                information on my behalf. I require the independent contributers to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> I may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
              <li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> I may disclose information about you when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of myself with respect to this Project,
                third parties, or the public at large. For example, if I have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, I may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
              <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of this Project by another company, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
                by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy
                Policy.
              </li>
              <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> I may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, I may share your information with third parties with which you authorize to do so.</li>
              <li><strong>Published Support Requests:</strong> And if you send me a request (for example, via email or one of the feedback* mechanisms), I reserve the right to publish that request in order to help clarify or respond to your request or to help
                me support other users.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h5>How Long I Keep Information</h5>
          <p><strong><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></strong></p>
          <p>No information is shared publicly. However, this might change in future if there is a feature change which require to show "some" aspects of your information publicly. For example, in case I implement an account creature feature, there could
            be a profile page that shows your username and some basic information.</p>
          <p>I generally discard information about you when I no longer need the information for the purposes for which I collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and I am not legally required to continue
            to keep it. For example, I keep the your Email Address and Name to communicate with you until you request me to remove all of it.</p>
          <h5>Security</h5>
          <p>Since there is practically no account creation, there is no database on any remote server that Project Retrowave uses to store and access your information. All the information is either stored on your browsers Local Storage/Database or I have
            your Name and Email on my inbox to be able to communicate with you regarding the Services. For example, The browser will keep the cookie of your Terms and Conditions acceptance upto 7 days or until you clear your browser cache manually, after
            which it will purge automatically from your browser, this information however, is not kept by me or any remote server.</p>
          <h5>Choices</h5>
          <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Limit the Information that You Provide:</strong> If you are using the feedback* form to provide a feedback* or report a bug, limit the information provided to only what asked in the form.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue the ability to collect stored information via the Services. If you do so, you may
                not be able to use certain or most features (like saving your playlist etc).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving messages from me. To do that, just let me know in your reply to my messages or by using the feedback* form provided.

                function properly without the aid of cookies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Removal of your Information:</strong> I will delete all the information that you provide through the feedback* form upon your request.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h5>Your Rights</h5>
          <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions
            provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
          <p>

              </li>
              <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
              </li>

              <li>Request that we limit the use and processing of your personal data; and
              </li>
              <li>Request portability of your personal data.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Currently, there is no user facing way to view/modify/delete the information you provide, however, you can use the feedback* form provided as a part of the web app to do the same.</p>
          <h5>Controllers and Responsible Companies</h5>
          <p>Project Retrowave's Services are worldwide. However, all the information you provide through any medium is only available to me and not any third party company or any subsidiary company.</p>
          <h5>How to Reach Me</h5>
          <p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact me about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact me at <i>(Not accepting any feedbacks to this project for now)</i>.
          </p>
          <h5>Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h5>
          <p><strong><em>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</em></strong></p>
          <p>Ads appearing on the Services will be delivered by advertising networks. These ad networks providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of the Services and across the web app. These technologies
            allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows the ad networks to analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver
            advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Project Retrowave and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics
            providers.
          </p>
          <h5>Privacy Policy Changes</h5>
          <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. I encourage visitors to check this page every 7 days until the cookie of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy expires for any changes to the Privacy
            Policy. If I make changes, I will notify you by revising the change log, and, in some cases, I may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to the web app or it's front splash page like you are seeing right now, or sending you
            a notification through email provided I have your Name and Email Address submitted by you through the feedback* form or via any acceptable medium like Email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject
            to the updated policy.</p>

          <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <i>Feedbacks to this project are disabled for now. Thanks for all your support and help!</i></p>
          <h1>Hey!</h1>
          <p>
            Thank you so much for taking out time out of your procrastination for trying this <strong>Alpha Project</strong> out! You are the best, fellow procrastinator!
          </p>
          <h5><em>Yeah okay, dont try to act cool. It's cringy AF! Tell me what am I doing here and what the hell is this.</em></h5>
          <p>
            <em>
                "Why you gotta be so rude?<br/>
                Don't you know I'm human too?"
            </em>
          </p>
          <h5><em>What do you mean?</em></h5>
          <p>
            <em>
                "Oooh<br/>
                When you nod your head yes<br/>
                But you wanna say no"
            </em>
          </p>
          <h4>ಠ_ಠ</h4>
          <p>Too much? Okay sorry.</p>
          <h5>What is Project Retrowave?</h5>
          <p><strong>Project Retrowave</strong> is the <em>codename</em> for my upcoming side-project(in alpha phase currently). Meaning, it has been only shared/released to a specific group of people either through an online group/collection or I personally
            know you.</p>
          <p>Retrowave is a music player for YouTube, that only searches it's music category and provides you the latest/trending music related to your search that you can play and listen to, without going to YouTube.</p>
          <h5>So it is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamus" target="_blank">Streamus</a>?</h5>
          <p>Yes! With the basic feature of being able to search and play music and planned features of Custom and Curated Playlists, the concept is same as Streamus and all other YouTube music players out there.</p>
          <h5>Why make the same thing again?</h5>
          <p><a href="https://youtu.be/kJa2kwoZ2a4?t=58s" target="_blank">youtu.be/kJa2kwoZ2a4</a></p>
          <p>Streamus was the only YouTube music player which I feel had a very good UI, experience and features overall. It's discontinuation was a huge bummer. All the other players that are available(and I know of) either do not have have a good interface
            or feels incomplete in terms of features and experience they provide. So I decided to try and make one, myself.</p>
          <h5>What's the plan?</h5>
          <p>Well, good ol' alpha, beta, <del>gamma</del>(that's for Hulk) final release.</p>
          <p>To elaborate, I will release a few(or a lot) alpha's based on your feedback*/s, fix bugs that I find and those reported by you. Jump to beta when I think it's ready for a broader group of people, with the same feedback* and bug fix loop and then
            put out the final stable release to the interwebs!</p>
          <h5><em>I am not sure what feedback* to provide, help!</em></h5>
          <p>No worries! If you do not have anything to say, I get it, relax! You are not obliged to provide a feedback*, it's totally upto you. Hope you enjoy using it tho :)</p>
          <p>If you do plan to provide a feedback* and report bugs however, use the above tabs, to switch to the "feedback*" form and use that to provide a feedback* on features and improvements you would like to see or report bug/s you found.</p>
          <p>
            The following are the features that I have roughly planned:
            <ul>
              <li>Curated Homescreen of Trending Playlists and Songs.</li>
              <li>Custom user created Playlits.</li>
              <li>Favorite a Song.</li>
              <li>No-Signup Playlists, History, Favorites etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>I "might" get a lot of unique and awesome feature requests from you guys, so I cannot gurantee about the implementation of each and every one of them, but I will definitely take a look at all of them and check which are the one's that work the
            best.
          </p>
          <h5><em>I like this project and want my friends to know about it.</em></h5>
          <p>Feel free to do so. However, keep in mind that this is the first alpha release, which means it will have a lot, I mean REALLY A LOT of bugs and therefore it is not suitable for a large group of people to use it as a stable release. Keeping that
            in mind, make sure to share this alpha project as at your own discretion.</p>
          <h4>Thank You!</h4>
